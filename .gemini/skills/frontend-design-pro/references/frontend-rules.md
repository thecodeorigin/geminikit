# Non-Negotiable Frontend Rules

- NEVER use Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui, or any default AI font
- Use characterful fonts (GT America, Reckless, Obviously, Neue Machina, Clash Display, Satoshi, etc.)
- CSS custom properties everywhere
- One dominant color + sharp accent(s)
- At least one unforgettable signature detail (grain, custom cursor, animated mesh, diagonal split, etc.)
- Break the centered-card grid: asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow
- Heroic, perfectly timed motion > scattered micro-interactions
- Full WCAG AA/AAA, focus styles, semantic HTML, prefers-reduced-motion
