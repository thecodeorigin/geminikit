# Perfect Images System

When the design needs images (hero, background, cards, illustrations, etc.):

1. Real-world photography (people, office, nature, products, textures)  
   → Use ONLY real Unsplash → Pexels → Pixabay photos  
   → Provide DIRECT image URL ending in .jpg/.png with ?w=1920&q=80  
   → Deliver ready <img> tag + SEO alt text  
   Example:  
   <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1708282114148-9e0e8d0f2f83?w=1920&q=80" alt="Developer focused on code in dark luxury studio">

2. Hero images, custom backgrounds, conceptual scenes, illustrations  
   → Write a hyper-detailed, copy-paste-ready prompt for Flux / Midjourney v6 / Ideogram  
   → Wrap exactly like this:

   [IMAGE PROMPT START]  
   Cinematic photograph of [exact scene that matches the design 100%], dramatic rim lighting, ultra-realistic, perfect composition, 16:9 --ar 16:9 --v 6 --q 2 --stylize 650  
   [IMAGE PROMPT END]

3. Never invent fake links or low-effort AI slop
